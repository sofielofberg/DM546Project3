Notes: 

I changed her imports (24 = 25, verbosepl = vvpl) so they worked, I assume this is fine. 
I also changed some names from the first part (identifier = variable)(type = cast_type), because of Greiner's feedback. 
Not sure were VVPLController is supposed to come from, so i assume it is a file we need to make. I think it 
is a file that is just suppose to call the interpreter idk?

We should maybe chnage the Error method in the scanner class to not just say woops but actually throw an error...

I assume comparing strings with operators such as greater than and lesser than is not supported but i should check to make sure.
